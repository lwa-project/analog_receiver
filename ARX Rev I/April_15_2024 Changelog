- Edge cut line thickness adjusted to 1.5 mm as recommended by JLCPCB
- Board length set to 6.750 inches.  Width Unchanged at 10.950 inches
- 50 Ohm impedance test strip added with DNI (Do not install) end launch SMA connectors
- 50 Ohm test strip labled to inform contract manufacturers and board houses that we will be checking impedance
- Diagnostic LEDs on first cascade SPI expander (U31) labeled to reflect actual function in circuit (G0_1, G0_2, BD_ID...).
- Move "SPI Cascade" Block to right to accomodate silkscreen text
- Move temperature sensor "TEMP3" to more isolated position
- Silkscreen comment block enlarged and moved to avoid obstruction with cable bundle
- Diameter of small wire-tie holes associated with MMCX connectors to 200 mils
- Decrease center-to-center spacing of wire-tie holes associated with MMCX connectors to 500 mils to provide more edge clearance
- Large wire-tie holes reduced to 248 mils (~6.2992 mm) to accommodate JLCPCB capability of 6.3 mm maximum hole size

**  Note end launch SMA connectors designed for 62 mils (1.57 mm) board thickness, actual thickness 60.6 mils (1.54 mm).
    No tolerance specification is given for recommended board thickness, but specified connector (Molex, 0734151471) will likely work.
