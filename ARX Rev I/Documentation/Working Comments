- Updated footprint for MCL attenuators (LWA RF:DG983-2) to include thermal vias connected to ground as specified in "98PL189.DWG".
    These vias, and also those associated with the "Gali" parts, are directly connected (solid, no thermal reliefs)

- To help with debugging and servicing, vias are located out from underneath parts. Traces connected to vias are extended outside the part.

- Rotate C151 in 83.7 MHz
- Remove GDTs
- UPdate PE42450 footprint to include vias
- Change SPI connectors to Whit's part with locking arrangement
- Silkscreen position are to accomdae more digits on higher values
- Reworked SPI Connectors (now MODII)
OK  - ???  Replace J5 (RS485)

Q:  Are filled vias in thermal pads really necessary?


- Grounding pads for shield
